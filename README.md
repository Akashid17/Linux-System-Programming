This Repositiry contains system programming applications.

FileSystem6.c is application to open another file using system call open and it will take input from user using scanf function.

FileSystem7.c is application same as FileSystem6.c. difference here is, input will be taken using command line argument.

FileSystem8.c is application which will take 2 inputs from user, 1st is file name and 2ns is Mode in which file wants to open. input will be taken using command line argument.

FileSystem10.c is application which will create new file with read and write permission and for that it will take file name as input from user using command line argument.

FileSystem11.c is application which will open and read file using open and read function and will print first 10 character, for that it will take input from user using command line argument.

FileSystem12.c is application which will open and read file using open and read function and will print data from that file, this application will accept input as file name and buffer size to fetch data.

FileSystem13.c This is application is similar to FileSystem12.c, to print data write function has used insted of print function.

FileSystem14.c This application will open file in read mode and print data using write system call. to print data i used predefine buffer of 1024 bytes. using predefine buffer and while loop, application will print entire data from file.
